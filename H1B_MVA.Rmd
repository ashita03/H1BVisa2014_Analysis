**1. Ask an important question you want answered (1 at least)**

A: 

* What are the different factors that contribute to H1B being accepted?

* Which factors can be clubbed, or which factors correlate to each other the most?


**2. Answer why this question(s) is/are important to you:**

A: 
The prevailing job market presents a significant hurdle for international students, especially concerning job opportunities and H1B sponsorships. Securing an H1B visa is crucial for students looking to remain in the country after completing the OPT-STEM extension. Given the current market dynamics, where many companies are refraining from sponsoring visas, a comprehensive analysis of this situation becomes imperative.
